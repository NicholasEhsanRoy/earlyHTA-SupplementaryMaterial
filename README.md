## Health Economic Model

For the Markov Models in the Health Economic Model of the report, a custom streamlit app was developed called SimpactHealth. The [source code](https://github.com/NicholasEhsanRoy/SimpactHealth) and [public deployment](https://simpact-health.streamlit.app/) are both made publically available. (note, it is possible you will have to wait a few minutes for the public deployment to "Wake Up" if it hasn't been used in a while).

The respository also contains raw csv data and a few python scripts that were used for things like the Sensitivity Analysis.
